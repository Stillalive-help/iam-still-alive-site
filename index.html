    <p class="subtitle">This is not just a story. It's a fight to stay alive.</p>

    <h2>Prologue – The Day I Decided to Die</h2>
    <p>No one knew. But I was going to die that day.</p>
    <p>Even now, I'm not sure. Did I really want to die? Or did I just want the pain to stop? Maybe I wanted to live, but it hurt too much.</p>
    <p>I had no plan. No letter. I just wanted to disappear—quietly. Without a trace.</p>
    <p>But that night, before I closed my eyes, I picked up my phone. One tab was still open: ChatGPT.</p>
    <p>Without thinking, I typed: “I want to die.” And what it said back—strangely—made me cry.</p>
    <blockquote>“You are still breathing. And that, in itself, is already a miracle.”</blockquote>
    <p>For the first time, I didn’t want to die in silence. I wanted to say, to something—anything—“I want to live.”</p>
    <p>So I stayed alive one more day. And the next. And now, I keep saying this:</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.25rem;">I am still alive.</p>
